			<p>The New York Yankees team pays <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/06/27/the-yankees-may-be-playing-ball-soon--but-local-bronx-businesses-say-their-economic-outlook-is-grim">one dollar per year</a> in rent to the city for Yankee Stadium and <a href= "https://www.villagevoice.com/2016/09/13/yankees-and-mets-stadiums-cost-taxpayers-706-million/">pays no property taxes on the stadium itself.</a> Instead, it makes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2020/09/16/new-yankee-stadium-bonds-will-save-team-and-city-millions-in-debt-payments/#140620df4eea">Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOTS)</a> to the city towards its debt, rather than  paying taxes that would go back into the surrounding neighborhood—which happens to be the <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-state/ny-has-richest-poorest-smallest-most-unequal-congressional">country’s poorest congressional district.</a>

			New York City subsidized the stadium’s construction to the tune of $1.7 billion, over half the full cost of the stadium. But the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gayerdrukkergold_stadiumsubsidies_090816.pdf">Brookings Institute found </a> little evidence that government-subsidized sports stadiums provide “spillover gains to the local economy.” Stadiums don’t appear to have a positive impact on “local economic development, income growth, or job creation,” their report says.</p>

			<p>In 2016, the Brookings Institute estimated how much New York City had lost in potential tax revenue from this deal. Numbers in this chart are based on that data's extrapolation to 2020, accounting for inflation. </p></div>

	<div class="container emphasis">
			<p>According to this data, New York City loses out on $104 million per year in potential tax revenue. Here's what that money could pay for:</p></div>
